What is Compose?
================

Creating labels from raw data for a machine learning problem is difficult and time consuming. This is where `Compose` helps by making it easier to quickly generate complex labels from raw data.

**Compose** is advanced software for automating the prediction engineering process. Compose enables you to systematically define prediction problems by automatically extracting historical training examples to train machine learning algorithms.

Install
=======

In Python 3.6 or later, you can install Compose by running the following commmand::

    pip install composeml
